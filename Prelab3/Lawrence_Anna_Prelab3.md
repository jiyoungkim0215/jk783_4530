1. How many grams of NaHCO3 would be required to keep the ANC levels in a lake above 50 µeq/L for 3 hydraulic residence times given an influent pH of 3.0 and a lake volume of 4 L, if the current lake ANC is 0 µeq/L?
* ANCo = [ANCout - ANCin(1-e^(-t/theta))]e^(t/theta)
* ANCout = 0.000050
* ANCin = -0.001
* theta = 1, t = 3
* ANCo = [0.000050 - (-0.001)(1-e^(-3/1))]e^(3/1) = 20.09 meq/L
* [NaHCO3]o = [(ANCo = 20.09 mmol of NaHCO3)/liter]* [(84 mmol of NaHCO3) / mmol NaHCO3)] * 4L
= 6750.25 mg

* did calculations by hand. Equation editor used in microsoft word.
