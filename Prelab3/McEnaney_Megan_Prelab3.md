1. How many grams of NaHCO3 would be required to keep the ANC levels in a lake above 50 µeq/L for 3 hydraulic residence times given an influent pH of 3.0 and a lake volume of 4 L, if the current lake ANC is 0 µeq/L?

\
To keep it above the target concentration, the minimum the concetration can be is 50 µeq/L at time t = 3θ

If the current ANC is 0 µeq/L, the only input that will affect ANC is that from the acid rain. Since pH = -log[H+], the equation can be reversed to find the eg/L of H} atoms: [H+] = 10^-3 = 0.001


Since the acid rain is the only input, the ANC_in = -[H+] in accordance with the formula.  ANC_in = -0.001 eq/L

The output ANC concentration is provided.
ANC_out = 0.00005 eq/L

Since ANC is a conservative property, the initial concentration can be determined through a mass balance differentiable equation.

ANC_o = [ANC_out - ANC_in ( 1 - e^(-t/θ))]*e^(t/θ)

ANC_o = [0.00005 - 0.0001 ( 1 - e^(-3θ/θ))]*e^(3θ/θ)
\
ANC_o = [0.00005 - 0.0001 ( 1 - e^(-3)]*e^(3)
\
ANC_o = 20.089 meq/L

[NaCHO3]_o = ANC_o
\
[NaCHO3]_o = 20.089 mmole/L * 84 mg NaCHO3/mmole * 4L
\
[NaCHO3]_o = 6750.17 mg
\
[NaCHO3]_o = 6.75 g

Therefore, to satisfy these ANC conditions we would have to add 6.75 g of NaCHO3.
