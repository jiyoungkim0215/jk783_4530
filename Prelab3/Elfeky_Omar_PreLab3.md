 How many grams of NaHCO 3would be required to keep the ANC levels in a lake above 50 μeq/L for 3 hydraulic residence times given an influent pH of 3.0 and a lake volume of 4 L, if the current lake ANC is 0 μeq/L?

 ANC= vol of equiv. * (volume of titrant)/vol of sample

 residence time = V/Q = rate at which average particle spends in the lake

 Lake volume at 4 L (V) then we can choose Q of 0.1, 0.5, 1 L/min
 residence times (theta) would be 40 minutes, 8 minutes, and 4 minutes respectively

 Translating this to grams of NaHCO3 needed is 40, 8 and 4 grams respectively.
